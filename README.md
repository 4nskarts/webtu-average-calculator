# WebTu OCR Average Calculator

Welcome to the WebTu OCR Average Calculator project! This project aims to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to calculate the average from the WebTu application.

## Project Overview

The WebTu OCR Average Calculator is an ongoing project designed to automate the process of extracting numerical data from the WebTu application using OCR technology and then calculating the average of the extracted numbers. This tool is intended to streamline data processing and improve efficiency for users of the WebTu application.

## Features

- **OCR Technology**: Utilizes advanced OCR techniques to accurately extract numerical data from images/screenshots of the WebTu application.
- **Average Calculation**: Processes the extracted data to compute the average value.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/4nskarts/webtu-average-calculator.git
    cd webtu-ocr-average-calculator
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    you have to have `tesseract`

## Usage

Currently, the project is in its early stages and is not yet complete. However, you can run the preliminary script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

_Note that you will need to have a jpg image or png to work with (a screenshot of your webtu grades)_
